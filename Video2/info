in this video I will show run jenkins docker on windows
then pipeline job base on Jenkinsfile in this github
with smart combobox PARAM, of Git Tags of this repo

if we want also branches names the command will be 
git ls-remote -t -h https://github.com/tomerb3/supremedevops.git

and not only 
git ls-remote -t https://github.com/tomerb3/supremedevops.git
